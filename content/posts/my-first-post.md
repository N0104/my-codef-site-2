Canadian solar is a publicly traded company that specialises in the manufacturing and implementation of solar panels globally. The growth of Canadian solar is a prime example of the effects of increasing demand for renewable energy, following the transition to a more sustainable society. In Q2 of 2020 the company experienced $696m net revenue, yet it was predicted $630-680m. Furthermore, market share for Canadian Solar increased by a record 1.7% in 2020, now occupying 9.2% of the market. These figures serve as a signal to the success and stable growth of the company, and the industry itself. This may provide hope to several investors left uneased by changing demand for oil and gas accelerated by the pandemic, as this solar company offers a reliable and sustainable solution to the transitioning demand for energy. They have been particularly successful in capturing the rising demand in energy globally including in several emerging countries. For example, iIn Malaysia, the company constructed one of the country’s largest rooftop solar projects, offering a significant source of energy for the country for the next 25 years. Furthermore in Brazil, as of 2019, Canadian Solar is planning to construct three solar photovoltaic projects. This demonstrates the key advantage renewable energy companies have over oil and gas firms, in the sense that resources can be produced in the country of consumption, rather than needing to export a product worldwide. This benefit has become more apparent with tougher restrictions on international trade and transport as a result of COVID-19. This could also explain the company’s lower operation costs relative to other oil companies, which also fell 17% between Q2 2019 and Q2 2020. Plans of continuous global expansion and development of more efficient panel models place Canadian Solar in a strong position with a positive long-term outlook.
