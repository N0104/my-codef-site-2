In 2020 BP made the decision to diversify their firm away from a focus on fossil fuels, presenting a renewable energy strategy and a more carbon efficient business model. This included a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 in addition to cutting production levels of oil. They also recently announced that they would pay for a 50% stake in wind farm projects with Equinor, entering the offshore wind market. I believe these decisions highlight the key changes that are required within the energy industry due to the increasingly serious and damaging risk of climate change. Acting as one of the leaders in the oil industry to diversify away from fossil fuels could serve as a way to gain trust from a wide range investors, particularly given that impact and ESG investing are increasingly important paths of investment decisions. Renewable energy is the long-term solution to a more sustainable future and getting ahead in this transition can benefit them in the long run. Yet along with this transition, 10,000 jobs are being scraped by the company. This raises concerns for disrupting employment levels and may counter the potential positive growth from announcing its new renewable strategy. It will be interesting to see how competitors within the oil industry react to this decision and whether it will spark a bigger industry-wide movement towards clean energy.
