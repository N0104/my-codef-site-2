With revenue growth of 44% in Q1 of 2021, Amazon is one of the fastest growing companies globally. The e-commerce industry is thriving, and this blue-chip company is arguably leading it. The company has built up strong brand loyalty, and continuous product diversification helps further growth. A large source of money is revenue generated from the sale of retail products, making up 67% of net sales in 2016. This includes selling Amazon-owned products like a kindle. The second and third largest contributors are third-party sellers and Amazon web services. Subscription services such as prime and Ad services also contribute to this sum of money. In addition to a wide set of revenue inflows, other factors drive Amazon ahead of its competitors. Unlike competitors like eBay, Amazon sells its own products in addition to facilitating third-party sellers.  
Furthermore, Amazon is customer-focused unlike most competitors such as Walmart which are more competitor-focused. This enables Amazon to draw in new audiences more effectively with new products, arguably a more profitable approach than the competitor-focused approach, competing for the same set of customers as competitors. Also, with long-term growth as the main company objective rather than profits, higher profits than competitors have been achieved.
