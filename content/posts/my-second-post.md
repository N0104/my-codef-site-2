Copper is a highly versatile material, used extensively in a wide range of products from electric vehicles to solar panels and other electronic equipment. In march 2020, prices fell to a four year low of $2.09/lb, before bouncing back 43% by September with a price of $3.1/lb. This trend of an overall strong incline of copper price is likely to continue into 2021, aided further by additional bullish factors, explored in this article. Current predictions by Reuters estimate a median price that is 12.5% higher than in 2020. Although, evidence of potential bearish influences may foster a weaker price growth in 2021. 

China is arguably a key driver of changing copper prices, accounting for a significant proportion of global demand for copper imports, over 30% in 2019. This is largely due to its manufacturing intensity, particularly surrounding construction, electrical equipment and electric vehicles, all of which contain copper. After the coronavirus pandemic initially invoked closure of a large number of factories, a steady sign of economic recovery with 5.8% growth towards the end of 2020 is generating significant increases in copper demand. As of September 2020, import quantities were up over 34% from the same period in the previous year. In addition, economic growth has been predicted at over 8.4% in 2021, and demand for electric vehicles (which China is the largest global producer of) is increasing significantly following a global drive for a more sustainable environment. These factors suggest Chinese import demand for copper is likely to rise even further in 2021. 

Furthermore, global supply chains and extraction practices for copper also had been significantly disrupted reducing the initial outbreak as a result of lockdown restrictions. This reduced extraction during the pandemic tightened supply, and with sharply rising demand only towards the end of 2020 and into 2021, the effects of shortfalls in extraction resulting in reduced supply are likely to be realised in full next year, adding to the bullish trend for copper in 2021. Coldero, one of the largest copper producers globally, halted several construction, expansion projects and unprofitable operations during the initial outbreak where prices fell to a record low. Although, recovery of demand for much other parts of the world remains weak, with global economic recovery forecasts for 2021 downgraded 0.3% by the IMF. In addition, plans of extensive copper production in 2021 may reduce the stress on supply, and therefore price. 

Biden’s presidency could also have important implications on the demand for copper in the following year. Infrastructure plans to shift the USA economy into a more sustainable direction costing $2trn will involve heavy use of metals including copper, and therefore are likely to stimulate further upward pressure on copper prices. 

To summarise, there are views of a Bullish market with many forecasters estimating a largely positive outlook on price, although uncertainty of global recovery may limit this increase. However, a vaccine may prove vital to recovery and demand stimulus, drawing up prices for copper in 2021.
